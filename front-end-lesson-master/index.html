      <p>
        My name is <span id="user-name">Michelle</span> and I'm exhuberant to be here, learning to code.

        <p>Describe the kinds of projects you like to work on and give a brief overview of how you accomplished them...</p>
        
        <h3>Bicycling</h3>
        <p>I volunteer with the San Francisco Yellow Bike Project (SFYBP) and learn how to fix bikes. The senior volunteers share their knowledge and walk me through the different facets of bicycles and bike repair. While I'm learning and they're teaching, the work we do also goes towards refurbishing old bike parts. Finished parts are sold (with profits funding the organization), or donated to low-income folks.</p>
          
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>Love it, can't stop it. I frequently plan for future meals and jot them down in Remember the Milk notes. I enjoy swapping stories with other food lovers and reading about recipes on foodblogs.</p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
        
        <p>What else do you do in your spare time?</p>
        
        <h3>Co-op</h3>
        <p>I live in a 13-person co-op called the Baker's Dozen. We're a variety of everything - ages, sizes, orientations, inclinations - and we try to live by the ideals we hold in our hearts. Key words: we try. The co-op isn't perfect, but it's a fabulous learning environment.</p>
        <ul>Things I've Learned
            <ul>
              <li>Develop communication and conflict-resolution skills</li>
              <li>How to feed bunnies!</li>
              <li>Build administrative processes with fellow housemates to support co-op functionality</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>The world has many wonderful things and I look forward to exploring as much of it as I can. I've been to 20 countries across 4 continents. At the moment, I'm rooting myself in San Francisco, developing skills and building community, so I think I'll keep it local and travel to cities in the United States. Next destinations are Seattle, Portland, New Orleans, and nature preserves in the Bay Area.</p>
        <ul>Cool Places I've Visited
          <ul>
            <li>House on Fire in Swaziland</li>
            <li>A Hindu Temple in Bali, Indonesia</li>
            <li>Craters of the Moon in Idaho, USA</li>
            <li>The Blue Mountains in Jamaica (featured in the above photo)<li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>(fun facts!)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I can wiggle my ears.</li>
          <li>I've made a 4 course meal for 15 people in 2.5 hours.</li>
          <li>I've had 3 bike accidents in the past year and I can't wait to get back to bicycling!</li>
        </ul>
